### Background
Since 2008, [Digital Paintball 2](https://digitalpaint.org/) is one of my top 5 video games. Over the years, I was curious how you can host your own Digital Paintball 2 server, and play with friends only. By joining the Digital Paintball 2 community through Discord, I learned how to host a Digital Paintball 2 server. After I learned how to setup a server, I wanted to clarify some server installation instructions. Fortunately, I got the opprotunity to contribute to this wonderful game by getting permission from the website owner  [jitspoe](https://github.com/jitspoe?tab=overview&from=2023-05-01&to=2023-05-02) to edit the server installation instructions.

### Before
This was the server page before it got edited.

### Options
Using the inspect elements feature in the browser, I edited the HTML code, and created some possible options.

### After
After deciding through the different options and being provided with the source HTML, this is final result.
